Data Analysis Project README
Project Overview
This project involves data analysis using Python and the pandas library. The goal of the project is to analyze a dataset containing educational results data from various districts and schools. The dataset is provided in a CSV file named 'UaceResults2011-2015.csv'.

The analysis will focus on understanding trends and patterns in student performance, such as percentage distributions in different score ranges, gender-based differences, and overall district performance.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
To run this project, you will need:

Python (version 3.6 or higher)
pandas library
numpy library
Setup
Clone this repository to your local machine:

shell
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/data-analysis-project.git
Navigate to the project directory:

shell
Copy code
cd data-analysis-project
Install the required libraries using pip (Python package manager):

shell
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy
Running the Analysis
Place the 'UaceResults2011-2015.csv' file in the project directory.

Open the Python script 'data_analysis.py' using your preferred text editor or integrated development environment (IDE).

Modify the script if necessary to adapt to your specific requirements or analysis goals.

Run the script:

shell
Copy code
python data_analysis.py
The script will load the dataset, perform analysis, and display the results in a DataFrame.

Code Explanation
The provided Python script 'data_analysis.py' performs the following steps:

Imports the necessary libraries:

python
Copy code
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
Reads the CSV dataset into a pandas DataFrame:

python
Copy code
df = pd.read_csv('UaceResults2011-2015.csv')
Conducts data analysis on the DataFrame, focusing on trends and patterns in student performance.

Displays the analyzed data in a tabular format.

Dataset Columns
The dataset contains the following columns:

District_Name: Name of the district.
SCHOOL: Name of the school.
Gender: Gender of the students (FEMALE or MALE).
Year-wise performance columns for 2011-2015 (e.g., '2011 Total', '%0-5 Points', '%6-10 Points', ...).
Results
The analysis provides insights into student performance across districts, schools, and gender. It offers an overview of how students scored within different point ranges over the years.

Conclusion
This data analysis project demonstrates how to use Python and pandas to analyze educational results data. It showcases the steps to load, manipulate, and analyze data, offering insights into student performance trends.

Feel free to explore and customize the code to suit your specific analysis needs.
